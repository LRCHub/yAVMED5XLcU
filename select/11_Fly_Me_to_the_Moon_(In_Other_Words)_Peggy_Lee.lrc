[00:58.85] Let me sing among those stars
[01:04.02] Let me see what spring is like
[01:07.76] On jupiter and mars
[01:17.26] 
[01:13.10] In other words, hold my hand
[01:21.59] In other words, baby kiss me
[01:35.59] 
[01:31.15] Fill my heart with song
[01:34.78] Let me sing for ever more
[01:40.09] You are all I long for
[01:43.45] All I worship and adore
[01:54.95] 
[01:49.24] In other words, please be true
[01:57.14] In other words, I love you

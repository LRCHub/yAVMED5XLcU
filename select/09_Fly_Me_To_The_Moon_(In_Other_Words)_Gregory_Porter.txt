Fly me to the moon
And let me play among the stars
Let me see what spring is like
On Jupiter and Mars

In other words
Hold my hand
In other words
Darling, kiss me

Fill my heart with song
And let me sing forever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore

In other words
Please be true
In other words
I love you

Fill my heart with song
And let me sing forever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore

In other words
Please be true
In other words
I love you

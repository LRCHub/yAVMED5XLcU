Poets often use many words
To say a simple thing
It takes thought
and time and rhyme
To make a poem thing
With music and words
I've been playing
For you I have written a song
To be sure that you'll know
what I'm saying
I'll translate as I go along
Fly me to the moon,
and let me play among the stars
Let me see what spring
is like on Jupiter and Mars
In other words: Hold my hand!
In other words:
Darling kiss me!
Fill my heart with song,
and let me sing forever more
You are all I long for all
I worship and adore
In other words: Please be true!
In other words: I love you! Oh
<♪>
In other words: Please be true!
In other words: I love you!
Oh Oh

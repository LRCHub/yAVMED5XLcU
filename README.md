```lrc
[00:12.77] Poets often use many words
[00:14.59] To say a simple thing
[00:17.40] It takes thought and time and rhyme
[00:20.09] To make a poem sing
[00:23.72] With music and words I've been playing
[00:28.23] For you I've written a song
[00:32.88] To make sure you know what I'm saying
[00:38.35] I'll translate as I go along
[00:52.35] 
[00:45.64] Fly me to the moon
[00:57.40] And let me play among the stars
[01:06.59] Let me see what spring is like
[01:08.33] On Jupiter and Mars
[01:14.78] In other words
[01:17.55] Hold my hand
[01:23.02] In other words
[01:26.61] Darlin kiss me
[01:33.61] 
[01:32.02] Fill my heart with song
[01:36.69] And let me sing forevermore
[01:43.07] You are all I long for
[01:46.65] All I worship and adore
[01:52.14] In other words
[01:53.91] Please be true
[01:59.45] In other words
[02:02.10] I love you.
